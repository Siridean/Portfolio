A program that takes a primary image, and a folder of 'source' images. It then creates a collage of the original image, using the source images.
Matching the source images as closely as possible to the origianl image RGB values.

Note: The method of finding the closest source image to the pixel's RGB value could be a simple pythagorus calculation.
It was done the way it is to create more of a challenge, and so that it works very well when you have many thousands of images (which I did for the test case).

My process is normally to use basic code and algorithms where possible to enhance readability and lead times.
I will only significantly optimise where appropriate and if there is a large leadtime (like a personal open-ended project)

Note example images not provided here due to personal nature of my output and source images. (Anniversary gift to my partner! :) )
